# 💰 RentLedger: Money-Flow Priority Matrix

## 🔥 TIER 1: MONEY CRITICAL (Build First or Die)
*If these don't work, you don't have a business. Period.*

### 🎯 Core Revenue Engine
1. **Billing System** - The literal money pipe
   - Generate rent bills
   - Track payment status (pending/paid/overdue)
   - Mark bill as paid + paidAt timestamp
   - Bill history per tenant/property
   
   **Why First?** → No bills = no money tracking = no product
   
   **What breaks without it?** → Landlords can't track who owes what. Zero revenue visibility.

2. **Multi-Tenant Architecture + Property Management**
   - `landlordId` scoping on all records
   - Create/edit/view properties
   - Tenant assignment to landlord
   
   **Why This High?** → You need somewhere to attach bills to. Bills without properties/tenants = useless.
   
   **What breaks without it?** → Can't associate money with actual real estate.

3. **Tenancy/Lease Management**
   - Create tenancy (tenant + property link)
   - Lease dates (start/end)
   - Prevent overlapping leases
   - Track active vs ended
   
   **Why Money-Critical?** → Determines who's supposed to pay rent. Overlapping leases = billing chaos.
   
   **What breaks without it?** → Could accidentally bill wrong tenant or double-bill same unit.

## ⚡ TIER 2: MONEY ENABLERS (Build Second)
*These make the money features actually usable in production.*

4. **Authentication & Sessions** ✅ *You got this started*
   - Signup/Login/Logout
   - Role-based access (landlord/tenant)
   - Session management
   - `getAuthContext()` → userId, landlordId, role
   
   **Why Now?** → Without auth, anyone can see/modify anyone's bills. That's a lawsuit.
   
   **What breaks without it?** → Zero security. One landlord sees another's revenue. Game over.

5. **PDF Generation (Receipts)**
   - Generate rent receipt PDF
   - Store in S3
   - Download receipt
   
   **Why Money-Related?** → Landlords need proof of payment for taxes. Tenants need receipts for records.
   
   **What breaks without it?** → Manual receipt creation. Landlord wastes hours. Won't pay for SaaS.

6. **Tenant Management**
   - Add tenant
   - Tenant profile
   - View all tenants per landlord
   
   **Why Here?** → You need tenant info to generate bills. But the core data model is simpler than billing logic.

## 🛠 TIER 3: OPERATIONAL NICE-TO-HAVES (Build Third)
*These improve experience but don't directly touch money flow.*

7. **Document Management**
   - Upload PDFs/images ✅ *You already got this*
   - Tag document type (lease, receipt, verification)
   - Link to tenant/tenancy/bill
   
   **Why Not Higher?** → Doesn't directly create or track money. Just organizes paperwork.

8. **Notifications & Reminders**
   - Rent due reminder
   - Overdue alert
   - Scheduled cron (monthly bill generation, overdue detection)
   
   **Why Important?** → Automates bill creation. Reduces missed rent. But doesn't break if you manually generate bills first.

9. **Maintenance Requests**
   - Tenant creates request
   - Landlord updates status
   - Track per property/tenant
   
   **Why Lower?** → This is about property upkeep, not revenue tracking. Nice to have but not money-critical.

10. **Utility Bills**
    - Electricity, water, etc.
    - Same status tracking as rent
    
    **Why Separate from Tier 1?** → Rent is primary revenue. Utilities might just be passed through. Build after core rent billing works.

---

## 📊 TIER 4: COMPLIANCE & REGIONAL FEATURES (Build Last)
*Location-specific or regulatory stuff. Important but not universal.*

11. **Police Verification (India-specific)**
    - Store verification number/date
    - Upload verification doc
    - Track status (pending/verified/expired)
    
    **Why Last?** → Only relevant in India. If you're launching in India first, bump this up. Otherwise, wait.

12. **PDF Monthly Statements**
    - Generate monthly statement PDF
    - Store in S3
    
    **Why Not Tier 2?** → Receipts are per-transaction (urgent). Monthly statements are nice summary reports (can wait).

---

## 🎨 TIER 5: POLISH & ANALYTICS (Build When Everything Works)
*Dashboard views - only valuable when data is flowing correctly.*

13. **Landlord Dashboard**
    - Active tenants count
    - Total properties
    - Rent collected vs pending
    - Overdue bills
    - Open maintenance requests
    
    **Why Last?** → Dashboards display data. Build the data capture first.

14. **Tenant Dashboard**
    - Current rent status
    - Bills history
    - Lease info
    - Maintenance requests
    
    **Same reason** → Display layer is worthless without working backend.

├─ 10. Document management integration
└─ 11. Utility bills (if needed)

Phase 4: Operations
├─ 12. Maintenance requests

## 🎯 The Quiet Strategic Truth

**Features that directly affect money flow:**
- Billing System ← **THE BIG ONE**
- Tenancy Management ← Determines who pays
- Property Management ← Determines what's being rented
- Auth ← Protects the money data
- PDF Receipts ← Proof of money movement

**Everything else is either:**
- Supporting infrastructure (tenant mgmt, docs)
- Nice-to-have automation (notifications)
- Compliance theater (verifications)
- Eye candy (dashboards)

**The Real Question:**
If you had to launch with ONLY 5 features to collect rent digitally, it's:
1. Auth (who you are)
2. Properties (what you own)
3. Tenancies (who rents what)
4. Bills (who owes what)
5. Mark Paid (receipt of money)

Everything else is optimization.

That's the stripped-down, no-BS truth. 💯
