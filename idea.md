## Idea

Build a **tenant–landlord management website** that helps landlords manage properties, tenants, rent, bills, and official documents in one place.

The system allows landlords to digitally maintain tenant records, track rent and utility bills, and generate official PDFs such as rent receipts, tenant verification forms, and bank-style statements.
Tenants can log in to view their rent history, bills, and download documents.

## Requirements / Features

- Users can sign up and log in

## Scope Clarification (important)
