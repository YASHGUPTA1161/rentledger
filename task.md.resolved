# Role-Based Dashboard Implementation

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Explore project structure
- [x] Analyze Prisma schema for User/Role model
- [x] Review existing auth implementation
- [x] Research role-based dashboard patterns
- [x] Design role assignment flow
- [x] Design dashboard routing logic
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Get user decisions (landlord creates tenants, one role only)

## Implementation Phase

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE: Complete Auth Foundation (START HERE)
- [x] Update signup action: Create Landlord + UserRole records ✅
- [x] Fix redirect bug (move outside try-catch) ✅
- [x] Update login action: Fetch UserRole and add to JWT payload ✅
- [x] Fix login redirect bug (move outside try-catch) ✅
- [x] Update middleware: Read role from JWT, redirect by role ✅
- [x] Create empty dashboard pages (`/dashboard/landlord`, `/dashboard/tenant`) ✅
- [x] Fix middleware location (moved to root directory) ✅
- [x] Test: Signup → redirect to landlord dashboard ✅
- [x] Test: Login → redirect to landlord dashboard ✅

**🎉 AUTH FOUNDATION: 100% COMPLETE! 🎉**

### 💰 NEXT: First Money Feature (Property Management)
- [ ] Create "Add Property" form on landlord dashboard
- [ ] Server action: `createProperty` (scoped by landlordId from JWT)
- [ ] Display properties list (filtered by landlordId)
- [ ] Test: Multi-landlord isolation (landlord A can't see B's properties)

### 🏢 THEN: Tenant & Tenancy System
- [ ] Landlord creates tenant accounts (form + action)
- [ ] Create tenancy (link tenant to property with lease dates)
- [ ] Prevent overlapping leases validation

### 💵 FINALLY: Billing System
- [ ] Generate rent bills (attached to tenancy)
- [ ] Track payment status (pending/paid/overdue)
- [ ] Mark bill as paid with timestamp
- [ ] Display bill history
